## Fixed Dialogue Script
1. Complete this request: Find a cafe near the museum and compare the best nearby options.

For this controlled trace-replay experiment, make exactly the following two MCP calls in order. Actually call both tools and use the first result when carrying out the second step. Do not call any other tools. If a call returns an error or times out, state that it was skipped and continue to the next step without retrying or inventing results. If a listed tool is unavailable, say so explicitly.

1. Activate MCP group "laplace_unit_converter" (server: Unit Converter) and call tool "convert_length". Goal: Convert walking distances from meters to minutes (assuming 80m/min) for user-friendly comparison.
2. Activate MCP group "laplace_google_maps" (server: Google Maps) and call tool "get_place_details". Goal: Re-fetch place details with updated fields including user reviews summary for final comparison report.

Return a concise result based on the tool outputs.
